Answers to After-lab Questions (if applicable)
-------

* Question 1:
  The timer Counts up. I have an overflow counter that keeps track of how many times the clock overflows. This is implemented in the Interrupt handler, and is factored into the calculations for pulse width.

* Question 2:
  The accuracy is within 4%

* Question 3:
  Its fairly accurate at a foot, and usually reads as such. Sometimes it can be jumpy but I beleive thats from an unstable platform and various interferences with the wave?
