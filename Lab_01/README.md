* Question 3:


Answers to After-lab Questions (if applicable)
-------

* Question 1:
  The Hardware debouncing circuit is a simple RC circuit that smooths out the voltage of the push button. It is effectivley a low pass filter.

* Question 2:
  Debouncing can be achieved in the software level through a couple techniques. One of these is a counter debouncer, that checks the button at intervals, and only confirms the button press after a number of stable readings.

* Question 3:
  We configure the push button to no pull up/no pull down because the internal resistors are too large which prevents the button toggling at normal speeds.

* Question 4:
  We want the low speed configuration for the LEDs to save power and to prevent excess EMI.
